# SECL (Sublime/Emacs Compatibility Layer)

SECL is a small plugin for Sublime Text 4 meant to provide an Emacs-like
experience inside of Sublime Text; it is a work in progress. 

The goals of this project are to provide traditional Emacs movement and editing
keybindings&mdash;e.g. `C-a` and `M-f`&mdash;out of the box, while also using
as much of Sublime Text's existing functionality as possible, i.e. the
default word-based movement should be used over a custom implementation.

For a more comprehensive Emacs emulation plugin, see [Emacs Pro Essentials](https://github.com/sublime-emacs/sublemacspro).

## Installation

You can install SECL by cloning or downloading this repository into your
Sublime Text packages folder.
