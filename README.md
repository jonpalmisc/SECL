# SECL (Sublime/Emacs Compatibility Layer)

SECL is a small plugin for Sublime Text 4 meant to provide an Emacs-like
experience inside of Sublime Text; it is a work in progress. This is an
opinionated project whose goals are to:

1. provide traditional Emacs movement and editing keybindings &mdash; e.g. `C-a`
and `M-f` &mdash; out of the box;

2. not re-bind existing Sublime Text actions to their equivalent Emacs
keybindings &mdash; i.e. `S-p` should not be replaced with `C-x p f`;

3. use as much of Sublime Text's existing functionality as possible &mdash; i.e.
the default word-based movement should be used over a custom implementation.

For a more comprehensive Emacs emulation plugin, see [Emacs Pro Essentials](https://github.com/sublime-emacs/sublemacspro).

## Installation

You can install SECL by cloning or downloading this repository into your
